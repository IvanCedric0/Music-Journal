## 🧠 Project Background

This project was born from a simple idea: consolidate my backend and authentication knowledge by building something **I personally care about** — music.

Instead of a basic to-do or blog app, I created a space to reflect on songs I love. That personal connection is what kept me motivated through bugs and polish phases.

This project was built after completing the **Authentication & Security module** of the Complete Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.
